A responsive nav bar made using CSS Flexbox and a colour changing heading using media queries.

#### Modifications
- Made site mobile-first
- Tried out the technique in [this post](https://www.madebymike.com.au/writing/precise-control-responsive-typography/) to scale the font size of the heading while the viewport width is within a certain range
- Used SASS to more smoothly transition through colors at different screen widths
